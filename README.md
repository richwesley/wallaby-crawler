Pub Crawl API
We are creating a bar crawl app that will take the city that the user types in, finds bars in that city, allows the user to select the bars they want to visit, and then map the userâ€™s selected choices in a google map type set up.

APIs we are using:
1.    Google Maps
2.    Yelp

Library we are using:
1.    Animate on scroll 
2.    Slick
3.    Animate.js

Plan:
1.    Have user pick location
2.    Throw up the bars in that location
3.    Have user select bars in that location
4.    Show bars user selected and a map with markers to those bars
